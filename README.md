# TextToSpeech
 This project is a Text to Speech application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application enables users to input any text, which is then converted into spoken words using the browser's speech synthesis capabilities. The project demonstrates how to effectively integrate web technologies to create a user-friendly interface that enhances accessibility.
